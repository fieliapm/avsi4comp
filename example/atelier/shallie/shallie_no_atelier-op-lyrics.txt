Golden clouds are sailing in the sky
I'm standing on thin ice

Black night is coming from above
No one can escape
Nowhere to hide anymore
We'll fall into an endless sleep

A gentle breeze touches my cheeks
Thin ice mirrors the sky burning

We know the world slowly makes all be back to the start
All of our wounds need to heal more or to get worse
Invisible forces lead us to where we belong
We're looking for reasons to resist or to surrender

I pluck nails stuck deeply in my feet
to try to walk again

Black night is coming from above
No one can escape
Nowhere to hide anymore
We'll fall into an endless sleep

A gentle breeze touches my cheeks
I feel I'm helpless
Time won't stop

We know the world slowly makes all be back to the start
All of our wounds need to heal more or to get worse
Invisible forces lead us to where we belong
We're looking for reasons to resist or to surrender

Fading light
You're so far away
We're burning and frozen
I walk to you
